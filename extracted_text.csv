"theestimates. Changes inestimates andjudgements arereflected intheinterim condensed consolidated financial statements intheperiod inwhich changes are"
"made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements."
"71.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments"
"a. Revenue recognition"
"The Group’s contracts with customers include promises totransfer multiple products andservices toacustomer. Revenues from customer contracts are"
"considered forrecognition andmeasurement when thecontract hasbeen approved, inwriting, bytheparties tothecontract, theparties tocontract are"
"committed toperform their respective obligations under thecontract, andthecontract islegally enforceable. The Group assesses theservices promised ina"
"contract andidentifies distinct performance obligations inthecontract. Identification ofdistinct performance obligations todetermine thedeliverables andthe"
"ability ofthecustomer tobenefit independently from such deliverables, andallocation oftransaction price tothese distinct performance obligations involves"
"significant judgment."
"Fixed price maintenance revenue isrecognized ratably onastraight-line basis when services areperformed through anindefinite number ofrepetitive acts"
"over aspecified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract isrecognized ratably using apercentage ofcompletion method when thepattern of"
"benefits from theservices rendered tothecustomer andtheGroup’s costs tofulfil thecontract isnoteven through theperiod ofthecontract because the"
"services aregenerally discrete innature andnotrepetitive. The useofmethod torecognize themaintenance revenues requires judgment andisbased onthe"
"promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables."
"TheGroup uses thepercentage-of-completion method inaccounting forother fixed-price contracts. Useofthepercentage-of-completion method requires the"
"Group todetermine theactual efforts orcosts expended todate asaproportion oftheestimated total efforts orcosts tobeincurred. Efforts orcosts expended"
"have been used tomeasure progress towards completion asthere isadirect relationship between input andproductivity. Theestimation oftotal efforts orcosts"
"involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information."
"Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services orthird-party vendor equipment orsoftware incertain integrated services arrangements. Inthese"
"types ofarrangements, revenue from sales ofthird-party vendor products orservices isrecorded netofcosts when theGroup isacting asanagent between the"
"customer andthevendor, andgross when theGroup istheprincipal forthetransaction. Indoing so,theGroup first evaluates whether itobtains control ofthe"
"specified goods orservices before they aretransferred tothecustomer. The Group considers whether itisprimarily responsible forfulfilling thepromise to"
"provide thespecified goods orservices, inventory risk, pricing discretion andother factors todetermine whether itcontrols thespecified goods orservices and"
"therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent."
"Provisions forestimated losses, ifany, onincomplete contracts arerecorded intheperiod inwhich such losses become probable based ontheestimated efforts"
"or costs to complete the contract."
"b. Income taxes"
"The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions."
"Significant judgments areinvolved indetermining theprovision forincome taxes, including amount expected tobepaid /recovered foruncertain tax"
"positions."
"Inassessing therealizability ofdeferred income taxassets, theManagement considers whether some portion orallofthedeferred income taxassets willnotbe"
"realized. The ultimate realization ofdeferred income taxassets isdependent upon thegeneration offuture taxable income during theperiods inwhich the"
"temporary differences become deductible. Management considers thescheduled reversals ofdeferred income taxliabilities, projected future taxable income"
"andtaxplanning strategies inmaking thisassessment. Based onthelevel ofhistorical taxable income andprojections forfuture taxable income over the"
"periods inwhich thedeferred income taxassets aredeductible, theManagement believes that theGroup will realize thebenefits ofthose deductible"
"differences. The amount ofthedeferred income taxassets considered realizable, however, could bereduced inthenear term ifestimates offuture taxable"
"income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15)."
"c. Business combinations and intangible assets"
"Business combinations areaccounted forusing IndAS103, Business Combinations. IndAS103 requires theidentifiable intangible assets andcontingent"
"consideration tobefairvalued inorder toascertain thefairvalue ofidentifiable assets, liabilities andcontingent liabilities oftheacquiree. These valuations"
"areconducted byexternal valuation experts. Estimates arerequired tobemade indetermining thevalue ofcontingent consideration, value ofoption"
"arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements arebased oninformation available attheacquisition date and arebased onexpectations and"
"assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1)."
"d. Property, plant and equipment"
"Property, plant andequipment represent asignificant proportion oftheasset base oftheGroup. Thecharge inrespect ofperiodic depreciation isderived after"
"determining anestimate ofanasset’s expected useful lifeandtheexpected residual value attheendofitslife.Theuseful lives andresidual values ofGroup's"
"assets aredetermined bytheManagement atthetime theasset isacquired andreviewed periodically, including ateach financial year end. Thelives arebased"
"onhistorical experience with similar assets aswell asanticipation offuture events, which may impact their life,such aschanges intechnology (Refer toNote"
"2.2)."

"Goodwill istested forimpairment onanannual basis andwhenever there isanindication thattherecoverable amount ofacash generating unit(CGUs) isless"
"than itscarrying amount. Fortheimpairment test, goodwill isallocated totheCGU orgroups ofCGUs which benefit from thesynergies oftheacquisition and"
"which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
